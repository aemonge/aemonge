# Andres Monge - Technical Lead / Solutions Architect
> _"We cannot release the patient from the OR like that"_

## Profile

A technical lead and engineer manager who is passionate about the new wave for AI development, and since then, I am in the process of moving away from front-end, and into machine learning and neural networks. I'm still an expert in web-development, highly efficient in JavaScript, DevOps and recently Ruby.

I provide value by translating KPI's or any business requirements into meaningful and planned chunks of technical tasks. Furthermore, I take ownership of the architecture and spike research, allowing my team to stay focused. I unblock the team by kick staring projects and proof of concepts, and dive deep into complex solutions.

I constantly try to take the extra effort to make my solutions functional and object-oriented, since I found that saves times eventually.
