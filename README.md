# Andres Monge - Technical Lead / Solutions Architect
> _"We cannot release the patient from the OR like that"_

## Profile

A trained **technical lead** and engineer **manager** who is passionate about the new wave for AI development. Looking to enter into the field of **neural network engineering**, using my previous skills in web (JavaScript/DevOps/Ruby) and new ones which are recently acquired.

I provide value by translating KPI's or any business requirements into meaningful and **planned chunks of technical tasks**. Furthermore, I take ownership of the **architecture and spike** research, allowing my team to stay focused. I unblock the team by kick staring projects and proof of concepts, and dive deep into complex solutions.

I constantly try to take the extra effort to make my solutions follow a **functional declarative and O.O. paradigm**, since I found that saves times eventually.
