        <p>Welcome to my digital playground where craftsmanship meets code. After 15+ years of building robust backend systems across various industries, I've developed a bit of an obsession with elegant, maintainable solutions.</p>
        <p>By day, I'm architecting scalable systems and mentoring teams. By night, I'm exploring functional programming paradigms, bringing concepts like immutability and type safety into my everyday work.</p>
        <p>Think of me as that colleague who gets a little too excited about test coverage and clean architecture, but who's also happy to guide you through your toughest technical challenges.</p>
